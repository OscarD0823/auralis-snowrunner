## Install

Open **Assets** on the [latest release](https://github.com/OscarD0823/auralis-snowrunner/releases/latest) and download **SnowRunner.Studio.Setup.exe**. Requires Windows x64 and a local SnowRunner installation; Node.js is only needed for development. Updates are distributed through GitHub, not Microsoft Store.

**Optional updates:** use ↻ to check for a new release, download it in your browser or keep the current version. Nothing is downloaded or installed automatically.

## Features

- Independent libraries for vehicles, trailers, engines, tires and winches.
- Base-game, DLC and mod filters, favorites, modified items and content rescanning.
- Explained settings, original values, three recommendation levels and `initial.pak` backups.
- A persistent vehicle preview beside the settings, including split-screen layouts.
- Compatible tire and suspension previews shown when editing those components.
- Local game images, supported mod thumbnails and manually assigned images where needed.
- An animated snow, mud, forest and rock scene with pause and reduced-motion support.

The interface offers SnowRunner's 13 languages. Names come from local game strings, with English fallback where a translation is missing.

## Safety and limitations

Close the game and keep your backups. Only **Save** applies edited parameters; preview selections never save automatically. Recommendations cannot guarantee stability for every vehicle, mod or situation.

The preview is a custom scene, not SnowRunner's engine or physics. It uses compatible local models, default attachments and the first available paint scheme, not your save-game customization. Some library thumbnails are representative; unsupported mod models retain their cover image.
